# XYZ Logistics Optimization
The analysis and recommendations for the XYZ Logistics Case Study, focusing on improving the operational efficiency of a last-mile delivery service operating in four metropolitan zones: North, South, East, and West.

## Objective
XYZ Logistics has been facing operational challenges including increased delivery volume, rising fuel costs, and frequent delays. This project analyzes the company's performance data and identifies key areas for improvement. The analysis also provides tailored strategies for each zone, focusing on optimizing delivery routes, improving customer satisfaction, and reducing costs.
## Key Features
- **Delivery Performance Analysis:** Provides insights on on-time delivery rates, delays, and average delivery times across different zones.

- **Operational Efficiency Metrics:** Analyzes the impact of peak hours, delivery costs, and average fuel consumption across zones to identify inefficiencies.

- **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Evaluates customer satisfaction through ratings and correlates it with delivery performance.

- **Recommendations & Strategic Actions:** Offers customized solutions for each zone based on data-driven insights.
## Analysis Summary

### 1. Delivery Performance

- The **West Zone** had the best on-time delivery rate, while **North Zone** lagged behind significantly.

- **East** and **North Zones** faced the highest number of delays, primarily due to peak-hour traffic and bottlenecks.

### 2. Operational Efficiency

- The **South Zone** had the highest average delivery time (111 mins) and the highest fuel consumption (3.64 liters per delivery).

- **East Zone** performed the best in terms of delivery times and fuel efficiency.

### 3. Customer Feedback

- **West Zone** had the highest customer satisfaction rating (4/5). Efforts are needed to improve the customer experience in other zones.

- Weak correlation was found between delays and customer satisfaction, indicating multiple influencing factors.

## Recommendations

- **North Zone:** Implement dynamic routing tools to adapt to real-time traffic conditions and reduce delays.

- **South Zone:** Optimize routes and deploy smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles to reduce high fuel consumption.

- **Routing Improvements:** Use machine learning models to predict optimal routes and peak-hour scheduling.

- **Peak-Hour Strategy:** Encourage non-peak hour deliveries by incentivizing customers to choose these time slots.

## Conclusion

By adopting the proposed strategies, XYZ Logistics can enhance its operational performance, minimize delivery delays, optimize fuel usage, and improve customer satisfaction.
